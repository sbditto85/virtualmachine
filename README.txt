Project 3

My program is executed by running:

vm.exe proj3.asm

which is a 32bit windows executable.

At the termination of project 3 by entering the @ symbol on my machine it doesn't eat the entered new line, as such that gets sent back to the terminal

As I discussed with you my labels all must end with a ':' which occurs everywhere, I did this for ease or parsing. If it doesn't have a ':' its not a label then if its not an instruction its invalid.  I know roughly how to change it to accept any type of label if needed, but really like the simplicity of having a ':' at the end.
